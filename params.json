Aromas of ripe, in season berries tempt and the sound of a pseudo thunderstorm rages over piles of countless garden breeds.  Walking through the produce section is an overload of sensory perception and can seem slightly overwhelming when trying to make healthy, yet affordable decisions in the market.  Questions rise such as, how many apples is in a pound?  What is the difference between organic and non- organic?  Is the 5 pound bag of oranges too many or will I end up throwing away a spoiled portion? If you are like me, sometimes I have found it easier to avoid the grocery store all together and substitute fast food, than to take the time to plan and budget a healthy diet.  Sadly enough, many individuals and families feel this way these days. By learning about healthy food selections, creating a food budget, planning and making a list before you shop, and preparing snacks and meals at home, it is possible to eat healthy on a slim budget.  \r\nOne way to save money on food,is to work out a budget, deciding how much money can be spent on food.  Say a college student has under $200 a month to buy food.  It is possible to eat healthy for under $200 a month, but leaves only a small margin for frivolous purchases. Low cost fruits and vegetables such as bananas, apples, potatoes, carrots, and greens are good choices. In addition to purchasing lower priced produce, shopping grocery store sales, buying fruit and vegetables in season, and buying store brands can save money on the weekly grocery bill.  Buying store brands alone can save a consumer up to thirty percent.   \r\nPlanning is one of the most important parts of eating healthy on a budget. The United States Department of Agriculture says on the webpage \"10 Tips to Help You Stretch Your Food Budget” that planning ahead will save you money on grocery shopping for the proper foods <https://Choosemyplate.gov>.  Precut foods are for convenience and cost much more.  It does not take long to wash and cut vegetables and fruits and the money saved really adds up.  Time spent preparing food will become part of a routine and become easier with practice.   It won’t take long for results to be noticeable in ones waistline and budget.    \r\nAnother aspect of planning is to prepare meals and snacks at home after paying the lowest price by shopping the weekly ads. When planning a weekly trip to the store, do an inventory of items you do not need, that you already have on hand.  As you plan the meals you will cook, incorporate foods left over from the week before, possibly even creating new dishes based on leftovers.  Also, to ensure getting the best price on expensive items, compare the sale ads in the newspapers for different stores.\r\nNow I will explain a simple way to save daily.  Granola and yogurt is a yummy, healthy snack. If I were to go to Starbucks to purchase Greek yogurt with granola 4 days a week, I would be spending $12 a week, on this snack.  I can buy a 32 ounce container of Dannon Light Greek Yogurt, for $4.88, and an 11 ounce bag of Kind Healthy Grains Cinnamon Oats With Flax Seeds Granola for $4.78.   For under $10, I have enough for 12 home prepared snacks, lowering the price of each snack to under $1.  This practice alone saves me $24 every 3 weeks.   \r\nHopefully next time you go shopping, instead of feeling intimidated in the produce section, you will think about what you have read, and think about all the fun varieties and flavors available for home cooked, affordable, healthy recipes, and get excited about cooking.   With careful planning, home prepared meals and snacks, and dedication, eating healthy on a budget is feasible. ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
